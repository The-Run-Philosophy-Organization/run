Online searches for words related to emigrating have spiked

Late last month China’s central propaganda department
announced a new campaign: “The Strong Nation’s
Rejuvenation Has Me”. The goal of this
odd-sounding effort is to rally red spirit before
the Communist Party’s 20th congress later this
year, when Xi Jinping hopes to secure a third
term as party chief. But a different kind of
rejuvenation is trending online, that of
“run philosophy”, a coded way of talking
about emigration. Instead of using a
character that suggests running away
from China, which would antagonise state censors,
netizens have been using one that sounds
like the English word “run”, but
means something different: run (moist).

Most of Shanghai’s 25m residents have
been locked in their homes for more than
a month in order to stem an outbreak of
covid-19 in the city. Case numbers are
dropping there, but rising in Beijing,
the capital, which is doing mass testing
and imposing targeted lockdowns. Business
leaders worry about the economic impact
of China’s covid controls. Many foreigners
are leaving—and, according to online search
trends, China’s young and educated elite
are thinking about doing the same.
